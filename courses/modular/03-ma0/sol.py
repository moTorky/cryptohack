11 ≡ x mod 6
To find the value of x such that 11 ≡ x mod 6, we can use modular arithmetic.

We start by subtracting 6 from 11 repeatedly until we get a number less than 6:

11 - 6 = 5
Now we can write 11 as 6 + 5, so we have:

6 + 5 ≡ x mod 6
Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can split this into two separate congruences:

6 ≡ 0 mod 6   (since 6 is a multiple of 6)
5 ≡ x mod 6
Therefore, x ≡ 5 mod 6. In other words, any integer that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 6 satisfies the original congruence 11 ≡ x mod 6.
in our case we want the smalest so we use k=0 and x=5
-------
-1%6=5 so why not use k<0 ?

You are correct that in modular arithmetic, the remainder obtained by dividing a negative number by a positive modulus can be a positive number. In your example, -1 ≡ 5 (mod 6) because -1 and 5 have the same remainder when divided by 6.

However, when we write an equation of the form a ≡ b (mod m), we are usually interested in finding a solution for a that is in the range from 0 to m-1 (inclusive), because these are the possible remainders when dividing a number by m.

If we allow k to be negative, we may obtain values of a that are outside of this range. For example, if we allow k = -1 in the equation 11 ≡ 6k + 5 (mod 6), we get:

11 ≡ 6(-1) + 5 ≡ -1 (mod 6)

This is a valid solution to the congruence, but it is not in the range from 0 to 5. If we want to find a solution that is in this range, we should choose k to be a non-negative integer. In this case, the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies the equation is k = 1, which gives:

11 ≡ 6(1) + 5 ≡ 5 (mod 6)

This solution is in the range from 0 to 5, and it is the solution that we are usually interested in finding.
-------
For the first congruence 11 ≡ x mod 6, we can use the solution we found earlier:

11 ≡ x mod 6
x ≡ 5 mod 6
Therefore, the solution is x = 5.

For the second congruence 8146798528947 ≡ y mod 17, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the number 8146798528947:


8146798528947 ≡ 4 mod 17
Therefore, the solution is y = 4.

Since we are asked to choose the smaller of the two integers, the final solution is 4.
