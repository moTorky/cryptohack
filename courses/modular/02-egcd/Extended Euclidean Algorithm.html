<h2 align="center">The Extended Euclidean Algorithm</h2>
As we know from grade school, when we divide one integer by another (nonzero) integer we get an integer <i>quotient</i> (the  "answer") plus a <i>remainder</i> (generally a rational number). For instance,
<center>  13/5  = 2 (<font color="red">"the quotient"</font>) + 3/5 (<font color="green">"the remainder"</font>). </center>
We can rephrase this division, totally in terms of integers, without reference to the division operation:
<center>13 = <font color="red">2</font>(5) + <font color="green">3</font>. </center>
Note that this expression is obtained from the one above it by multiplying through by the divisor 5.  <p>
 We refer to this way of writing a division of integers as the <b>Division Algorithm for Integers</b>. More formally stated:
</p><blockquote>
If a and b are positive integers, there exist integers unique non-negative integers q and r so that
<center>a = qb + r , where 0<img src="Extended%20Euclidean%20Algorithm_files/le.gif" alt="[less than or equal]" align="middle">r &lt; b.</center>
</blockquote>
q is called the <i>quotient</i> and r the <i>remainder</i>.
<p>
The <i>greatest common divisor</i> of integers a and b, denoted by <i>gcd(a,b)</i>, is the largest integer that divides (without remainder) both a and b. So, for example:
</p><center><table cellspacing="15">
<tbody><tr><td>gcd(15, 5) = 5,</td><td>gcd(7, 9) = 1,</td><td>gcd(12, 9) = 3,</td><td>gcd(81, 57) = 3.</td>
</tr></tbody></table></center><p>
The gcd of two integers can be found by repeated application of the division algorithm, this is known as the <b><i>Euclidean Algorithm</i></b>.
 You repeatedly divide the divisor by the remainder until the remainder 
is 0. The gcd is the last non-zero remainder in this algorithm. The 
following example shows the algorithm.
</p><p>Finding the gcd of 81 and 57 by the Euclidean Algorithm:
</p><center>  81 = 1(<font color="red">57</font>) + <font color="green">24</font><br>
  57 = 2(<font color="red">24</font>) + <font color="green">9</font><br>
  24 = 2(<font color="red">9</font>) + <font color="green">6</font><br>
  9 = 1(<font color="red">6</font>) + <b>3</b><br>
  6 = 2(<font color="red">3</font>) + 0.
</center>
<p>
It is well known that if the gcd(a, b) = r then there exist integers p and s so that:
</p><center>p(a) + s(b) = r.</center>
By reversing the steps in the Euclidean Algorithm, it is possible to 
find these integers p and s.  We shall do this with the above example:<p>
Starting with the next to last line, we have:
</p><center><b>3</b> = 9 -1(<font color="green">6</font>)</center>
From the line before that, we see that <font color="green">6</font> = 24 - 2(<font color="red">9</font>), so:
<center><b>3</b> = 9 - 1(24 - 2(<font color="red">9</font>)) = 3(<font color="red">9</font>) - 1(24).</center>
From the line before that, we have  <font color="green">9</font> = 57 - 2(<font color="red">24</font>), so:
<center><b>3</b> = 3( 57 - 2(<font color="red">24</font>)) - 1(24) = 3(57) - 7(<font color="red">24</font>).</center>
And, from the line before that <font color="green">24</font> = 81 - 1(<font color="red">57</font>), giving us:
<center><b>3</b> = 3(57) - 7( 81 - 1(<font color="red">57</font>)) = 10(57) -7(81).</center>
So we have found p = -7 and s = 10.<p>
The procedure we have followed above is a bit messy because of all the 
back substitutions we have to make.  It is possible to reduce the amount
 of computation involved in finding p and s by doing some auxillary 
computations as we go forward in the Euclidean algorithm (and no back 
substitutions will be necessary). This is known as the <b><i>extended Euclidean Algorithm</i></b>.</p><p>
 Before presenting this extended Euclidean algorithm, we shall look at a
 special application that is the most common usage of the algorithm. We 
will give a form of the algorithm which only solves this special case, 
although the general algorithm is not much more difficult.</p><p>
Consider the problem of setting up the Hill cryptosystem. We were forced
 to do arithmetic modulo 26, and sometimes we had to find the inverse of
 a number mod 26. This turned out to be a difficult task (and not always
 possible).  We observed that a number x had an inverse mod 26 (i.e., a 
number y so that xy = 1 mod 26) if and only if  gcd(x, 26) = 1.  There 
is nothing special about 26 here, so let us consider the general case of
 finding inverses of numbers modulo n. The inverse of x exists if and 
only if gcd(x, n) = 1. We now know that  if this is true, there exist 
integers p and s so that 
</p><center> px + sn = 1.</center>
But this says that px = 1 + (-s)n, or in other words,  px<img src="Extended%20Euclidean%20Algorithm_files/equiv.gif" alt="[equivalent]" align="middle">1
 (mod n). So, p (reduced mod n if need be) is the inverse of x mod n. 
The extended Euclidean algorithm will give us a method for calculating p
 efficiently (note that in this application we do not care about the 
value for s, so we will simply ignore it.)<p>
</p><h3>The Extended Euclidean Algorithm for finding the inverse of a number mod n.</h3>
We will number the steps of the Euclidean algorithm starting with step 0. The quotient obtained at step i will be denoted by q<sub>i</sub>. As we carry out each step of the Euclidean algorithm, we will also calculate an auxillary number, p<sub>i</sub>. For the first two steps, the value of this number is given: p<sub>0</sub> = 0 and p<sub>1</sub> = 1. For the remainder of the steps, we recursively calculate p<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>i-2</sub> - p<sub>i-1</sub> q<sub>i-2</sub> (mod n).  Continue this calculation for one step beyond the last step of the Euclidean algorithm. <p>
The algorithm starts by "dividing" n by x. If the last non-zero 
remainder occurs at step k, then if this remainder is 1, x has an 
inverse and it is p<sub>k+2</sub>. (If the remainder is not 1, then x does not have an inverse.) Here is an example:
