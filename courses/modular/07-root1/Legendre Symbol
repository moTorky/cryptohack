from prtvice module we need to make N operation to check if the number have a squre root
p = 29
ints = [14, 6, 11] 
>>> find_squar_root(p,14)
>>> find_squar_root(p,6)
8
21
>>> find_squar_root(p,11)
we have a way to check whether an integer is a quadratic residue with a single calculation thanks to Legendre. In the following, we will assume we are working modulo a prime p.
